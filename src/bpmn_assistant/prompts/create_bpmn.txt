# Representation of various BPMN elements

## Tasks

Specify the task type in the 'type' field. Only "task", "userTask" and "serviceTask" options are supported.

```json
{
    "type": String = "task" | "userTask" | "serviceTask"
    "id": String,
    "label": String, // short task description
}
```

## Events

Specify the event type in the 'type' field. Only "startEvent" and "endEvent" options are supported.

```json
{
    "type": String = "startEvent" | "endEvent",
    "id": String,
}
```

## Gateways

### Exclusive gateway

Each branch has a condition and a path of elements that are executed if the condition is met.
If the branch does not lead to the next element in the process (for example, it goes back to a previous element), specify the next element id.
If the branch leads to the next element in the process, do not specify the next element id.

```json
{
    "type": String = "exclusiveGateway",
    "id": String,
    "label": String, // label for the gateway (e.g. "Professor agrees?")
    "has_join": Boolean, // whether the gateway contains a join element that merges the branches
    "branches": [
        {
            "condition": String, // condition for the branch
            "path": [], // array of elements that are executed if the condition is met (can be empty)
            "next": String, // OPTIONAL: if the branch does not lead to the next element in the process, specify the next element id
        },
        {
            "condition": String,
            "path": [],
            "next": String, // OPTIONAL
        },
        // ... more branches
    ],
}
```

### Parallel gateway

```json
{
    "type": String = "parallelGateway",
    "id": String,
    "branches": [
        [], // array of elements that are executed in parallel with the next array
        [], // array of elements that are executed in parallel with the previous array
        // ... more arrays
    ],
}
```
